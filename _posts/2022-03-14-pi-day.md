How many digits of π can you recite? Generally, 3.14 is all we need. Some may approximate it using the fraction 22/7. Even just 3 is a good enough approximation for some folks. Here's the lede: **I know π to the 52nd decimal place.**

How did I learn it? Remember when iPod Touches were new and fun and we had a whole bunch of novelty apps, like Tap Tap Revolution and Temple Run? Those were the days.

Anyway, I had an app that turned memorizing π into a game. You'd type in the numbers, and whenever you got one wrong, it would show you the next 5 digits. That gave me an excellent opportunity to memorize the number in groups of a few digits at a time.

This is how I know π, showing the groups I have it memorized in:

> 3.14159
> 
> 265
>
> 358979
>
> 32384
>
> 62643383
> 
> 27950288
>
> 4197169
>
> 39937
>
> 51058

This is not a very applicable skill: there's no many situations (except today) where it becomes useful. 

Hope you have a good π day!
