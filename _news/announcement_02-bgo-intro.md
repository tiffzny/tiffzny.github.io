Starting in April 2022, I will be the **new** Astronomy Technician (aka Observatory Keeper) with the [Burke-Gaffney Observatory](https://observatory.smu.ca) at Saint Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

***

Being the Astro-Tech at SMU for the BGO will include keeping the observatory working and running, including the social-media-controlled-robot, as well as providing support for Astronomy classes and students, and allowing groups and the public to come visit the observatory to see space for themselves, with their own eyeballs.
