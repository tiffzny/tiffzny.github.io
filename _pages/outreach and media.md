I strive to share "space stuff" as broadly as I can. There's a sense of wonder, inspiration, and curiosity that can come from engaging with the vastness of the sky and the types of things we get to see within it: aurora, eclipses, meteor showers, beautiful changing phases of the moon, etc. 

I'm grateful for the many opportunities I've had to engage with the public through [BGO Tours](https://observatory.smu.ca/bgo-visit) and opportunities to engage with students through teaching, and there's also something particularly unique and rewarding about participating in media: radio, TV, print, online that gets to engage and even larger community - those that may not seek out astro-information on their own.

Much of my outreach work is inspired by two mentors of mine: [Dr. Rob Thacker](https://www.ap.smu.ca/~thacker) and the late [Dr. Dave Lane](/blog/2024/dave-lane/), who both have encouraged me endlessly in a variety of ways.
