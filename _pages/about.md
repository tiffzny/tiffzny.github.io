I'm Tiffany, excited about sharing the world of astronomy or math or science with you. 
Here's some of the really neat positions I've held recently:
* Physics Lab Instructor at Saint Mary's University
* Astronomy Instructor at Washtenaw Community College
* Educational Assistant at [WISEatlantic](http://wiseatlantic.ca/)
* Telescope Operator & Tour Guide at the [Burke-Gaffney Observatory](https://www.ap.smu.ca/pr/bgo)
* Planetarium Show Host at the [Discovery Centre](https://thediscoverycentre.ca/)

I'm into helping others understand things, understanding things, and making things work.
