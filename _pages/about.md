I'm Tiffany, excited about sharing the world of astronomy or math or science with you. 
<b>I'm the (new!) Astronomy Technician for the [Burke-Gaffney Observatory](https://observatory.smu.ca) at Saint Mary's University in Halifax, NS.</b>

Here's some of the neat positions I've held in the recent past:
* Virtual Planetarium Show Presenter at [Astronomy in Action](https://www.astronomyinaction.com/)
* Physics Lab Instructor at Saint Mary's University
* Astronomy Instructor at Washtenaw Community College
* Educational Assistant at [WISEatlantic](http://wiseatlantic.ca/)
* Telescope Operator & Tour Guide at the [Burke-Gaffney Observatory](https://observatory.smu.ca)
* Planetarium Show Host at the [Discovery Centre](https://thediscoverycentre.ca/)

I'm into helping others understand things, understanding things, and making things work. I also have two dogs, both with space-themed names (Ripley and Kepler).
