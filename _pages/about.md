I'm Tiffany, excited about sharing the world of astronomy or math or science with you. 
<b>I'm the Astronomy Technician for the Astronomy & Physics department, including the [Burke-Gaffney Observatory](https://observatory.smu.ca), at Saint Mary's University in Halifax, NS.</b> I love to look at the sky (and will gasp and exclaim "look at the moon!" whenever I notice it) and want to help you do the same.

Here's some of the other neat positions I've held in the past:
* Virtual Planetarium Show Presenter at [Astronomy in Action](https://www.astronomyinaction.com/)
* Physics Lab Instructor at Saint Mary's University
* Astronomy Instructor at Washtenaw Community College
* Educational Assistant at [WISEatlantic](http://wiseatlantic.ca/)
* Planetarium Show Host at the [Discovery Centre](https://thediscoverycentre.ca/)

I'm into helping others understand things, understanding things, and making things work. I also have three dogs, all with space-adjacent names (Ripley, Kepler, and Nimbus).
